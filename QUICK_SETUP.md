# Quick Setup Guide for Self Authentication

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Your CryptoVerse game is now equipped with Self Protocol authentication! Follow these steps to get it running:

### Step 1: Start Your Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
âœ… Your server should be running on http://localhost:3001

### Step 2: Expose Your Backend to the Internet

Since Self Protocol needs to reach your backend, you need to create a tunnel:

#### Option A: Using Localtunnel (Easiest)
```bash
# In a new terminal, in the backend folder:
npm install localtunnel
npx localtunnel --port 3001
```

#### Option B: Using Ngrok (More Reliable)
1. Install ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download
2. Sign up for a free account and get your auth token
3. Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
4. Run: `ngrok http 3001`

### Step 3: Start Your Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Configure the Tunnel URL
1. Visit http://localhost:5173
2. Try to access any protected route (like `/game`)
3. The app will ask you to enter your tunnel URL
4. Enter the HTTPS URL from step 2 (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
5. Click "Continue with this URL"

### Step 5: Test Authentication
1. You'll see a QR code
2. Download the Self app on your phone (iOS/Android)
3. Scan the QR code with the Self app
4. Complete identity verification
5. You're now authenticated and can access the game!

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Tunnel URL not working"
