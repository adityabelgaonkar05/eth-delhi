# CryptoVerse Professional Business Dashboard - Contract Architecture

## Overview
This refactored smart contract system transforms CryptoVerse into a professional business dashboard focused on crypto video premieres with advanced airdrop and reputation mechanics. The platform rewards audience engagement based on off-chain reputation rather than traditional on-chain leveling or XP systems.

4. **Efficient Batch Processing**: Gas-optimized batch operations for large participant lists
5. **Automatic Refunds**: Undistributed tokens automatically refundable to organizers

### Walrus Network Integration
1. **Video Content Storage**: Main video files stored on decentralized Walrus network
2. **Metadata Management**: Event and NFT metadata stored on Walrus with content hash verification
3. **Storage Tiers**: Multiple storage options (ephemeral, standard, permanent)
4. **Cost Configuration**: Configurable storage costs for different tiers

### Sybil Attack Prevention
1. **Self Protocol Integration**: Human verification through Self Protocol
2. **Multi-Source Reputation**: Reputation validation from multiple external sources
3. **Oracle Consensus**: Multiple oracle nodes validate reputation data
4. **Risk Scoring**: Automated Sybil risk assessment (0-1000 scale)
5. **Blacklisting System**: Address-level and campaign-specific blacklists

### Professional Business Features
1. **Business Verification**: Paid verification system for legitimate businesses
2. **Comprehensive Analytics**: Detailed metrics on attendance, engagement, and ROI
3. **Revenue Tracking**: Platform fee management and revenue distribution
4. **Performance Rankings**: Reputation-based organizer rankings
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Support for thousands of participants per event

## Security Features

### Escrow Security
- Timeout mechanisms for token reclaim (30 days default)
- Emergency withdrawal after timeout
- Multi-signature admin controls

- Consensus requirements (minimum 2-3 nodes)
- Signature verification for all data submissions

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Organizer, Oracle)
- Multi-level admin roles for different operations
- Pausable contracts for emergency situations
- Upgradeability through proper proxy patterns

## Gas Optimization

### Batch Operations
- Batch attendee registration (up to 200 per transaction)
